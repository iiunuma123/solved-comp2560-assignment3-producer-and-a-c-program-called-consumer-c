Write a bash program called <em>producer</em> and a C program called <em>consumer.c</em>. A text-based data file called <em>storage</em> initially contains an integer number between 5 and 90.

The producer checks the number in the storage. If the current number plus 8 will be 100 or larger, it will terminate. Otherwise, it will increase the number in the storage by 8 and then call the consumer to continue.

The consumer decreases the number in the storage by 3, and then calls the producer to continue.

Both the producer and the consumer can be the starter.
